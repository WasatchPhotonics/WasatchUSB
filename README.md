WasatchUSB - USB cameras and devices from Wasatch Photonics 

This module is intended to provide the absolute bare-minimum, pure
python communication with a StrokerARMUSB board. These tests include
communication with a Phidgets relay device, to place the device in a
known power state.

Feature identification is supported through the scripts/feature.py file.
Run this program to dump the current configuration of any feature
identification supporting device.
